Official code for the paper 
"MatrixWorld: A pursuit-evasion platform for safe multi-agent coordination and autocurricula", 
which has been submitted to Arxiv and journal for peer-review.


### Description

MatrixWorld is 
- a safety constrained pursuit-evasion platform for safe multi-agent coordination,
- a lightweight co-evolution environment for autocurricula research.

In this work, 
- the safety is defined in terms of multi-agent collision avoidance.
It covers diverse safety definitions in the real-world applications.
- 9 pursuit-evasion game variants are defined for example scenarios
like real-world drone and vehicle swarm,
multi-agent path finding (MAPF), 
popular pursuit-evasion setups, 
and classic cops-and-robbers problem.

It can be used for the research of
- safe multi-agent environment implementation,
- safe multi-agent reinforcement learnng (MARL),
- safe multi-agent coordination,
- co-evolution, autocurricula, self-play, arm races, or adversarial learning.
